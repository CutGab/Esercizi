#3-3. Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. 
# Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

Machines: list = ["Wolkswagen", "Mitsubishi", "Honda", "Panda"]

print (f"I would like to own a {Machines[0]}")
print (f"I would like to ride a {Machines[1]}")
print (f"Thank god I don't have a {Machines[2]}")
print (f"I don't care for the {Machines[3]} ")
